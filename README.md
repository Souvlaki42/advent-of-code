# Advent of Code

My advent of code solutions starting from 2024. I'm using rust for now. I might use other languages or try other years' challenges in the future.

> [!NOTE]
> This is my personal repo for my solutions to the advent of code challenges.
> I don't include my input files in this repo, so you should use your own.
> I'm not trying to compete with anyone, I just want to learn and have fun solving some challenges.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is not neccessarily the most optimal solution. I might do some optimizations later on.

> [!WARNING]
> I'm not responsible for any consequences of using this repo. Use it at your own risk.
