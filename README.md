# Advent of Code

My advent of code solutions starting from 2024. I'm using rust. I might do previous years as well.

> I don't include the input files in this repo, you can use your own or download them from the official website.
> I'm not trying to compete with anyone, I just want to learn rust and do some challenges.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is not neccessarily the most optimal solution. I might do some optimizations later on.
